To compile use:
```shell
./antw
```
or `ant` if you have Ant in your PATH. Alternatively, you can double-click on `antw` or `antw.bat` on Windows.

To create a runnable JAR, run `./antw dist-jar`, or run `ant dist-jar` if you have Ant in your PATH. The JAR will be placed in the `dist` directory.

To run use:
```shell
./run
```
Alternatively, you can double click on `run` or `run.bat` on Windows.

You can always download the most up-to-date pre-built JAR from [GitHub Actions](https://nightly.link/Flanlaina/ArrayV-v4.0/workflows/ant/personal-build/standalone-jar.zip) (link via [nightly.link](https://nightly.link)).

You have to use command line if you want to add additional arguments to the program. To do so, use:
```shell
./run <arguments>
```
